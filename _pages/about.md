I research reinforcement learning with graph based methods in the CDT for Accountable, Responsible, Transparent AI, under the supervision of Prof Özgür Şimşek.

The complex graphical structure generated by interactions between a reinforcement learning agent and its environment is a rich source of additional infomration that can be exploited for a number of aims. My research combines graph theory and reinforcement learning for policy explanation and transfer learning.
