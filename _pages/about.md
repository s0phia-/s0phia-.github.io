I research reinforcement learning with graph based methods in the CDT for Accountable, Responsible, Transparent AI, under the supervision of Prof Özgür Şimşek.

The complex graphical structure generated by interactions between a reinforcement learning agent and its environment is a rich source of additional infomration. My research deconstructs reinforcement learning policies into subtasks using this graphical structure. For example, a policy for making tea might be decomposed into the steps: boil water; place a teabag in a cup; pour water over the teabag. My research has two aims: the first is to deconstruct existing policies into subtasks to provide an explanation of how the overall policy will behave, and the second is to extract useful subtasks that might be transferred to new tasks.

When I am not keenly coding I love playing chess, bouldering, and practicing German.
